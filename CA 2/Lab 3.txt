Answer----------------------------------------------------
1 to 1 
DESIGN OPTIONS
1. embed patient document in medical history document
2. embed medical history document in patient document
3. link patient medical history with patient by posting patient ID
4. link medical history with patient by posting medical history ID

Considerations:
Maximum document size limit?
How is the data frequently accessed?
How will the documents grow?
Overhead of moving large document to and from the database.
--------------------------------------------------------------



Answer--------------------------------------------------------
1:F
Same choices as above but you will have an array of embedded documents
on one side containing the _ids of the other
Embedding department documents within the organisation document may make sense


Answer---------------------------------------------------------
M:M
This can be done through linking.

A link array is an array of IDS in one direction or both directions.
Embed the array on one side of the relationship.
